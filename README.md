# ec-lab-helper
A little webtool to create EC-Lab routines as the original EC lab routine creation is very buggy and annoying.

# Documentation and HowTo
On the top, the webtool has two input fields to set the global boundaries for the CVs and all the other measurements.
Underneath there are buttons to add measurement routines, you have to specify all the parameters for the specific measurement.
With the "Export config file"-button you can download your individual config file and import it to EC-lab
